"""The episode index - one compact row per episode, so a reader never has to parse
the stream to browse it.

The file monitor writes a row as each episode lands, when the record is already in
hand and summarising it is nearly free, and records the chunk and byte offset it wrote
the episode at so a reader can seek straight to one. A stream another producer wrote
has no index, so its reader derives the same rows itself.
