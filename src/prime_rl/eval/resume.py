"""Resume an interrupted eval from its trace stream.

The stream records what landed, so it is what a resume continues from. The run's ok
episodes are read back and rejoin the epoch as if they had just arrived - through the
monitors, so the rebuilt stream, the epoch's metrics and the platform upload cover the
whole epoch - and only the rollouts still owed run. Errored episodes and the in-flight
ones the interruption cut off are owed again.

A landed episode counts toward the task with its ``task.key``, so a resumed run may
select more or fewer examples or rollouts per example than the interrupted one: the
kept episodes are matched to the new selection and the rest is owed. The resumed
config is not checked against the interrupted one: any of it may be overridden.
