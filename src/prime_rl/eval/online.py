"""Online evals: evaluate the trainer's weight broadcasts as they appear.

Spawned by the ``sft`` launcher (``python -m prime_rl.eval.online @ eval.json``)
next to the trainer. The process watches a broadcasts directory for offered weight broadcasts through a
``WeightReceiver`` (announced by their ``.sender_ready`` marker), moves the inference
server onto each of them, and runs the due eval sources against the updated weights,
sequentially per broadcast so every epoch measures exactly one policy version. Every
offered broadcast must be received, even when no eval is due — the trainer blocks inside
the handshake until the receiver acknowledges. By default, a newer checkpoint cancels
unfinished episodes from the prior version; ``cancel_on_new_checkpoint = false`` drains
every epoch instead."""
