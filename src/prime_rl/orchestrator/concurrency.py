"""ConcurrencyController: adaptive cap on in-flight units of inference work.

A unit is whatever the dispatcher admits against one permit — the controller
treats it as a black box. There is no cost model: the controller measures KV
pressure off the engines and reacts at the pipeline's own pace (AIMD):

- **Grow** the cap multiplicatively per pipeline turnover (each completion
  advances the turnover by ``1/inflight``) while the engines are clear and
  the cap binds admission. The multiplier tapers linearly with GPU-KV usage
  until the soft-cap boundary.
- **Trim** above ``KV_USAGE_SOFT_CAP``: lower the cap to what the engines
  hold at ``KV_USAGE_TARGET`` and let completions drain the pool (soft). If
  usage still climbs past ``KV_USAGE_HARD_CAP`` — units maturing in place
  outpace completions — also cancel the excess, youngest first (hard).
- **Cut** on overload: preemptions (single-shot loads) or a persistent
  capacity queue (agentic loads never preempt — admission control parks
  excess load in the waiting queue). Cut, cancel the excess, then freeze
  cuts until the pool drains below the new cap.

The cap starts at ``initial_inflight`` (else the pessimistic bound
``KV capacity / max_model_len``) and is clamped to
``[min_inflight, max_inflight]`` throughout.

The controller is a pure state machine — it owns no tasks or clients. The
metrics collector pushes ``observe(samples)`` every poll; the dispatcher
reports ``record_episode(...)`` per completed unit and consumes the cap via
the hooks bound in :meth:`bind`.
